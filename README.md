Inspired by https://github.com/tmccarthy/ausvotes


Very simple data driven approach to parse out all voting preference allocation patterns
without even looking at HTV. 

These are tabulated and the most common ones are likely to be HTV or donkey votes

Tasmanian data used as a test give pretty promising results with preference string followed by count

Original above found about 14k which is about the sum of the first 4 shown
